We have two Kia Fortes, both of which were purchased from leasing companies.

One is a 2009 model and the other is a 2012 model, but they're pretty much the same car.

Pictured on the left below is the remote that we got with the 2012 car. Pictured on the right is the remote that we got with the 2009 car.

On the two remotes we got with the 2009 car (both with the same design), the buttons are still in excellent condition.

But as you can see from the pictures, the same cannot be said for the remote we got with the 2012 car. The buttons wore out pretty quickly after we got the car. I was able to order spare key pads on eBay for a decent price, but the ones I ordered also were worn out after about a year.

So the question I have is what's different about the design and/or materials used in the remotes for the two different cars ?

And if it's a question of materials, could the difference in price be significant enough to justify providing the customer with a remote whose buttons have to replaced on a yearly basis ?

Once I get commenting set up on this blog, I'm going to ask my friend Lorne, a mechanical engineer who's worked on cell phone design, to weigh in on this.
