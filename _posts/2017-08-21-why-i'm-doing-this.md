I created this blog with three purposes in mind:
1.To give me a place to put down in an organized manner my thoughts about various poorly designed systems I encounter - from software with a poorly designed interface to simple mechanical systems that we encounter on a regular basis.
2.To have a way of getting suggestions from other people on how to improve these systems.
3.When it comes to poor design that is still out there (as opposed to something historical), there is always hope that those responsible for it will be willing to accept feedback and make improvements. I hope that eventually this blog will serve as a way to bring these kind of suggestions to their attention.
