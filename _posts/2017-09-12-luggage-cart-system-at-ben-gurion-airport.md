title: "The new luggage cart system at Ben-Gurion Airport"

Over the past few weeks, I was at the airport a number of times, and while there, I spent some time watching people interact with the new system at Ben Gurion for taking and returning luggage carts.

The purpose of the system is pretty simple: to get people to return the carts to specific areas where other travelers can get them - instead of leaving them scattered in different parts of the airport.

However, due to pretty poor design of the system, I noticed many people having trouble with it. My rough estimate is that at least one of every four people doesn't succeed in getting their 10 NIS deposit back.

These are my suggestions for how the system can be improved:
* Almost all the machines I saw were showing the text in English. It was clear that there were travelers who did not understand the English. I was a little shocked that at the Israeli airport there was no Hebrew. Then I saw at least one machine with a Hebrew interface. It took me quite a while to realize that there were very small flags in the top right corner of the screen, and users were meant to push these to change the language. Unfortunately, there is nothing about the flags that makes you think that they are "pushable". Ordinarily, items that can be pressed on a screen are designed so that they are obvious. The best approach here would be to have the first screen contain only clear buttons for selecting a language.
* For some reason, alongside the screen there was a sign with instructions. If you're already computerizing a system, why not have all the instructions on the screen ? Or even better make sure that the interface is clear enough that you don't need dedicated instructions.
* The order of required actions is not intuitive. In my opinion, the step that represents "why the user is there" should always be last. That way they're not going to forget anything. For example, in an ATM, the last step is to take your money. If it wasn't that way, you might forget your card in the machine. But if you came for the express purpose of taking out money, you're not going to forget the money. Same with the luggage carts. The person came to the machine to get a cart. So the last step should be to remove the cart.

Based on the above, I would have the screens set up as follows:

*For taking a cart:*
1. First screen: choose a language
2. Second screen: select the action (taking a cart vs returning a cart)
3. Show message to put in a credit card
4. Processing of card (charging the deposit)
5. Show message to remove card
6. User pulls out card
7. Show message telling user they can now take a cart
8. Leave the last message up until the user takes the cart, and then re-display the first screen (choose language) for the next user

*For returning a cart:*
1. First screen: choose a language
2. Second screen: select the action (returning a cart)
3. Show message telling user to insert their credit card
4. User puts in credit card
5. Show message telling user to push the cart back in 
6. User pushes cart back in
7. Processing of card (returning the deposit)
8. Show message telling user that the deposit has been returned and they can now remove their credit card
9. Leave the last message up until the user takes their card out, and then re-display the first screen (choose language) for the next user

Note: There is one other issue that contributes to confusion and that is the fact that you can only get the money back on a credit card that was used to take a cart. However, this seems to be a policy decision and not a design-related one (perhaps to prevent destitute individuals from hanging out at the airport and making money from returning abandoned carts ?). So I can't see them changing this rule.
