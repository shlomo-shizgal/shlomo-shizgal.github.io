<p>I already have a blog on Wordpress where I write occasionally - mostly about Israeli politics and society - and mostly in Hebrew.</p>

<p>I decided to set this site up on github for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>

<li>To have a place to post information of a more professional nature - relating to programming, interface design, and technical writing</li>
<li>To serve as a home for my design blog, which I just started</li>
<li>To play around with site generation using Jekyll and Markdown</li>
<li>To have a place to post various other odds and ends, such as books or music that I recommend</li>

</ul>
