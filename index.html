title: Shlomo Shizgal's personal site

I already have a blog on Wordpress where I write occasionally - mostly about Israeli politics and society - and mostly in Hebrew.

I decided to set this site up on github for a number of reasons:
1. To have a place to post information of a more professional nature - relating to programming, interface design, and technical writing
2. To serve as a home for my design blog, which I just started
3. To play around with site generation using Jekyll and Markdown
4. To have a place to post various other odds and ends, such as books or music that I recommend
